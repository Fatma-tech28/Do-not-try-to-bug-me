Project Team Role Definitions

Project: [Don't try to bug me ]
Team:**Rawda Mohammed** , **Alaa Mohammed** ,**Fatma Abd Elrazek Kamal** , **Hanin Hussain** , **Sondos ghrib**, **Alaa hindawy**

This document outlines the primary responsibilities for each team member to ensure a smooth workflow and successful project completion as a primary member role.
1. **Data collection & Preparation Team**
Members: **Rawda Mohammed & Alaa Mohammad**

Primary Mission: To source, acquire, clean, and prepare the raw data for the entire team. You are the foundation of the project.
Key Responsibilities:
· Data Sourcing: Identify and gather data from relevant sources (e.g., public datasets, APIs, web scraping, provided files).
· Data Loading: Use Python libraries (like pandas, numpy, os, requests) to load data into our analysis environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks).
· Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct inconsistencies in the data.
· Data Wrangling: Transform and structure the raw data into a usable format. This includes merging datasets, creating new calculated fields, and filtering records.
· Data Documentation: Document the sources, cleaning steps, and any assumptions made about the data for the rest of the team.
· Hand-off: Deliver a clean, well-structured dataset to the Statistical Analysis and Visualization teams.

Key Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, requests, beautifulsoup4 (for web scraping).

2. **Data Visualization & Presentation Team**
Members: **Fatma Abd Elrazek & Hanin Hussain** 
Primary Mission: To translate complex data and analysis results into clear, compelling, and insightful visual stories for the final presentation.

Key Responsibilities:

· Visualization Design: Create meaningful graphs, charts, and dashboards that effectively communicate the patterns, trends, and insights discovered in the data.
· Tool Proficiency: Utilize visualization libraries in Python (matplotlib, seaborn, plotly) to build static and interactive visuals.
· Storytelling: Develop a logical and persuasive narrative flow for the presentation. You decide the best way to tell the data's story.
· Presentation Development: Design and assemble the final presentation deck (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides, Jupyter Notebook slides).

· Clarity and Design: Ensure all visuals and slides are aesthetically pleasing, easy to understand, and free of errors.

Key Tools: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, PowerPoint/Google Slides, Canva (optional for design). 

3. **Statistical Analysis & Modeling Team**
Members: **Sondos & Alaa hindaWY**

Primary Mission: To apply statistical techniques to the cleaned data to uncover underlying patterns, test hypotheses, and provide data-driven insights.

Key Responsibilities:

· Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform initial investigations on the data to summarize its main characteristics, often using visual methods.
· Statistical Testing: Apply relevant statistical tests ( t-tests, chi-square tests, correlation analysis) to validate assumptions and relationships.
· Trend Analysis: Identify and quantify trends, patterns, and anomalies within the data.
· Interpretation: Translate statistical findings into plain English and actionable insights for the Visualization team to present.
· Collaboration: Work closely with the Data Acquisition team to request specific data transformations and with the Visualization team to ensure the graphs accurately reflect the statistical results.

Overall Team Collaboration & Workflow

1. Kick-off: The entire team agrees on the project's core question and objectives.# completed
2. Data Hand-off: fatma has provided the cleaned dataset to Sondos, Alaa, Fatma,rawda and Hanin.
3. Analysis  Sync: Sondos & Alaa, hanin share key findings with Fatma & rawda to guide the visual storytelling.
4. Presentation Build: Fatma & Hanin build the presentation, incorporating visuals based on the cleaned data and annotated with insights from the statistical analysis.
5. Review & Rehearse: The entire team reviews the final presentation for consistency, accuracy, and impact.
6. Whole team would share making tableau and power BI design.
